## 1.	Deciphering Big Data
### A summary of the learning outcomes of the module
•	Study various concepts of big data, technologies, and data management to enable students to be able to identify and manage challenges associated with security risks and limitations.
	
• Critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies and tools in problem solving.

•	Explore different data types and formats. 

•	Explore and evaluate various data storage formats ranging from structured, quasi structured, semi structured, and unstructured formats.

•	Essentially examine different data collection methods and sources. 

•	Review methods to determine the integrity, reliability and readiness of data extracted and presented for pre-processing, cleaning, and usage.

•	Examine data exploration methods and analyse data for presentation in an organisation. 

•	Critically evaluate data readability, readiness, and longevity within the data Pipeline. 

•	Examine cloud services, for example the API (Application Programming Interfaces) and how this enables data interoperability and connectivity.

•	Examine and analyse the ideas and theoretical concepts underlying DBMS (Database Management Systems) Database Design and Modelling.

•	Conduct a deep analysis of the future of use of data and deciphering by examining some fundamental ideas and concepts of machine learning and how these concepts are applied in various methods in handling big data.

### Collaboration discussion: 
Critically evaluate the rationale behind the Internet of Things (IOT), in the context of, highlighting the opportunities, limitations, risks and challenges associated with such a large-scale process of data collection.

### Summary Post
### Banking sector IoT data collection
Kopetz and Steiner  (2022) state that IoT is a  connection of physical things to the internet and this makes it possible to access remote sensor data and to control the physical world from a distance. The logic behind the IoT in a banking sector focused on enhancing operational efficiency, customer experience, data driven decision making and availability of real time data for business processes. This idea is tone down by significant limitations, risks and challenges. 

### Opportunities 
There is real-time data collection from ATMs, branches, mobile apps, and wearables to improve service delivery to customers. The IoT allows for integration of physical and digital banking environments, allowing banks to personalise services and optimise resource allocation. The IoT sensors and biometric devices improve surveillance and authentication, reducing fraud risk.

### Limitations
Despite the big improvement and  promises by the IoT in the banking sector, banks still face several constraints such as infrastructure gaps where in regions like South Africa, inconsistent connectivity, and power supply limit IoT deployment. Based on this, banks may struggle to process and extract actionable insights from vast, unstructured IoT data streams. Poorly cleaned data, missing data, and inaccurate data may lead to incorrect decision making in a banking environment.

### Risks 
Large-scale data collection introduces serious concerns in the IoT platform for example, privacy and consent where continuous monitoring of customer behaviour raises ethical questions about informed consent and data minimisation. The IoT devices are often poorly secured, creating entry points for attackers targeting financial systems. It is imperative that data cleaning to check for extreme values or outliers is effectively done because, if this matter is not dealt with before the analysis, the results will be skewed and unreliable.

### Challenges
The main challenge of IoT is digital inequality in financial exclusion which happens in rural or low income populations where lack of access to IoT platforms or poor connectivity is experienced. Proper and credible techniques must be used to deal with unit nonresponse from data collected thought the IoT platform. The ethical use of AI in leveraging IoT data for automated decision making for example loan approvals will result in high bias and discrimination if this is not properly managed.

### Conclusion
Larger scale IoT applications offer transformation opportunities in efficiency, innovation, and sustainability. To achieve these benefits, one requires a multidimensional strategy that addresses security, interoperability, scalability, regulatory compliance, and human factors.
